Hypothesis:
Stock market predictions is one of the topics that does not go out of style - we decided to use our new found machine learning and deep learning knowledge to take a shot at it. Using a long term approach we are trying to predict the overall trend of certain portfolios and find out which factors can be considered market movers. We decided to use 3 different portfolios and add economic data and google trend analysis to see if it made the predictions better. 

Models:
1.The rolling-out-of sample approach is an approach more akin to real life (you likely re-estimate your model when new data becomes available).

2.In addition to being more realistic, the rolling-out of sample approach is also more rigorous, as you are testing your model many more times across different time periods. Therefore, we expect a slightly higher out-of-sample RMSE, which is what we can't see.

3.The fact that the two model are not close to each other in value though does suggest that our model is not stable.

#Linear Regression Model

Itâ€™s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

1.Step 1: Import packages and classes
2.Step 2: Provide data
3.Step 3: Create a model and fit it
Step 4: Get results
5.statsmodels if you need the advanced statistical parameters of a model

#LSTM RNN SEQUENTIAL MODEL

LSTM works better and predict more accurate.
LSTM using Google pytrends works better too in predicting the future values
