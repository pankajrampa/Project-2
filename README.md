# Project-2
TARIK HAMZA, ROD TUCKER &amp; PANKAJ RAMPAL

Hypothesis:
Stock market predictions is one of the topics that does not go out of style - we decided to use our new found machine learning and deep learning knowledge to take a shot at it. Using a long term approach we are trying to predict the overall trend of certain portfolios and find out which factors can be considered market movers. We decided to use 3 different portfolios and add economic data and google trend analysis to see if it made the predictions better.
